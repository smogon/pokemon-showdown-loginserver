**Pokemon Showdown Loginserver.**

This is the PS loginserver.
Build it with `npm run build`, and run it with `npm run start`.

You can access it via either `/action.php`, or `/api/[desired action]`.

See `src/actions.ts` for a list of the actions. (Actions can be added by adding a function to that file)
